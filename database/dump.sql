A specific assessment list aims to help verify the application of each of the key requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Human agency and oversight: AI systems should empower human beings, allowing them to make informed decisions and fostering their fundamental rights. At the same time, proper oversight mechanisms need to be ensured, which can be achieved through human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, and human-in-command approaches</li>\r\n	<li>Technical Robustness and safety: AI systems need to be resilient and secure. They need to be safe, ensuring a fall back plan in case something goes wrong, as well as being accurate, reliable and reproducible. That is the only way to ensure that also unintentional harm can be minimized and prevented.</li>\r\n	<li>Privacy and data governance: besides ensuring full respect for privacy and data protection, adequate data governance mechanisms must also be ensured, taking into account the quality and integrity of the data, and ensuring legitimised access to data.</li>\r\n	<li>Transparency: the data, system and AI business models should be transparent. Traceability mechanisms can help achieving this. Moreover, AI systems and their decisions should be explained in a manner adapted to the stakeholder concerned. Humans need to be aware that they are interacting with an AI system, and must be informed of the system&rsquo;s capabilities and limitations.</li>\r\n	<li>Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness: Unfair bias must be avoided, as it could could have multiple negative implications, from the marginalization of vulnerable groups, to the exacerbation of prejudice and discrimination. Fostering diversity, AI systems should be accessible to all, regardless of any disability, and involve relevant stakeholders throughout their entire life circle.</li>\r\n	<li>Societal and environmental well-being: AI systems should benefit all human beings, including future generations. It must hence be ensured that they are sustainable and environmentally friendly.

Not physically, of course, but virtually. Every day cyber threats are detected and cyber-attacks&nbsp;thwarted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping European citizens safe in the connected world is a priority for the European Commission, and ENISA, the EU&rsquo;s cybersecurity agency, has an increasingly important and central role in this endeavour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, or ENISA for short, was originally set up in 2004 to help ensure a high level of network and information security within the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based in Greece, ENISA supports the European institutions, the Member States and the business community in addressing, responding to and especially in preventing network and information security problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally created as a relatively small agency with a limited budget and mandate, new EU-level cybersecurity legislation is beefing up ENISA&rsquo;s role and mandate significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already the 2016 Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive gave additional tasks to the agency. That Directive created for the first time a network of the Member States&rsquo; Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), in order to promote swift and effective operational cooperation on specific cybersecurity incidents and share information about potential risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENISA acts as the secretariat to the CSIRT network. Similarly, ENISA has a less proactive but equally important role&nbsp;to play as a member of the NIS Cooperation Group, also created by the NIS Directive and providing advice and expertise and facilitating information sharing among Member States.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The need for a truly pan-European cybersecurity agency is clear.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Exposure to various cyber threats in the EU remains high. According to ENISA&rsquo;s own&nbsp;2018 Cyber Threat Landscape&nbsp;report, which focuses on the 15 top cyber-threats from malware to denials of service, the number of attacks has remained relatively stable over the last few years (although the exact figures are hard to calculate because the baseline is continuously shifting as ever more attacks are automatically detected and defended against).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What has changed dramatically though is the level of sophistication of many of the attacks, meaning that our responses have to become increasingly sophisticated as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, as the number of cyber threats has risen, there was a clear political wish to enhance ENISA&rsquo;s remit, along with its budget and its mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Cybersecurity Act, a regulation proposed in 2017, which will come into force in spring 2019, the European Commission, put forward a number of new initiatives to further improve EU cyber resilience, deterrence and defence, including significantly&nbsp;expanding and strengthening the mandate and role of ENISA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes a permanent mandate for the agency (previously, ENISA&rsquo;s mandate had to be renewed every seven years) and a much greater operational budget (more than doubling from the current &euro;11m per year), as well as handing ENISA a clear operational and not only advisory role in European cybersecurity.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Moreover, the Cybersecurity Act also entails the creation of a European Cybersecurity Certification Framework in which ENISA will play a key role.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>For businesses and consumers to be certain that their online information is safe, they need to use products, services and processes that they trust, but the lack of a single EU-wide scheme to certify this trustworthiness is a major problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, products sometimes have to be certified in several different countries following different processes, which limits cross-border trade within the EU and implies big cost for the consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new framework sets out the&nbsp;rules, requirements, standards and procedures with which EU-wide certification schemes will have to comply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is for ENISA to organise the development of such (for the time being voluntary but this may also change with time) schemes for a wide variety of ICT products and services, from smart cards to cloud computing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, the Cybersecurity Act maintains ENISA&rsquo;s advisory role; In addition to expanding on its existing remit, the agency will for example assist EU and national authorities on priority setting in research and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will also work closely with the proposed new&nbsp;European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre. The latter&rsquo;s task would be to help the EU retain and develop the cybersecurity capacities that underpin the continued development of the EU&rsquo;s Digital Single Market.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The challenge to keep European citizens and businesses safe and secure in today&rsquo;s connected world will continue to require our attention and investments for many years to come.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe has kicked into a higher gear already, boosting its cybersecurity capabilities through legislation such as the NIS Directive or the Cybersecurity Act, and carrying out joint manoeuvres through increasing coordination and cooperation between national and EU players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new certification framework will bolster Europe&rsquo;s civil defence mechanisms, reassuring users that they can continue to operate safely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the new European Cybersecurity Competence Centre will ensure that the next generations of secure products and services but also of the engineers and programmers to create them will be available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENISA is there with a new permanent mandate to support the EU and EU Member States in sharing vital cybersecurity information, to assist in coordinating the key players and to give the right advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may never be entirely free from the threat of cyber-attacks but our new comprehensive framework should provide the additional and necessary guarantees to live and work in a safer environment.</p>', 'post', 'active', 270, '2019-07-08 05:33:00', '2019-07-08 02:11:39', '2021-05-10 16:31:22', NULL, 'A revamped ENISA – the EU’s cybersecurity agency', 'A revamped ENISA – the EU’s cybersecurity agency', 'A revamped ENISA – the EU’s cybersecurity agency', 'ru', '<p><strong>A revamped ENISA &ndash; the EU&rsquo;s cybersecurity agency</strong></p>'),

Several large-scale accessibility efforts have been implemented in the EU over the last year, as part of an ongoing effort to address and prioritize accessibility for these individuals, as well as the many others who will benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a major milestone when the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) were published in June 2018. The updated WCAG 2.1 was followed shortly after that with the first implementation deadline of the EU Web Accessibility Directive in September 2018. Most recently, the <a href=\"https://www.3playmedia.com/2019/03/22/european-accessibility-act-eaa/\">European Accessibility Act (EAA)</a> was approved and will be most impactful for individuals with disabilities as well as the elderly in the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Public v. Private Sector Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Directive specifically applies to public-sector websites and apps, it still has a profound impact on private companies as well. Organizations that regularly do business with or provide products or services to governmental sites will need to have their standards up to par. These private-sector companies may also face greater competition, or even lose users with disabilities if their websites or apps are inaccessible and provide a comparably less accessible experience than their public-sector competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>European Web Accessibility Directive v. WCAG: What&rsquo;s The Difference?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The core of the EU Web Accessibility Directive is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\">the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>.&nbsp; the Directive uses the four principles of WCAG 2.0, requiring that public sector websites across EU member states are &ldquo;Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be wondering why the Directive was necessary if it&rsquo;s so similar to the already existing WCAG. The answer can be summed up in one word: enforcement. WCAG 2.0 (and the updated WCAG 2.1) are sets of guidelines. While they have an incredibly significant and extensive impact, they are not legally enforceable on their own. Weaving the principles of WCAG into the Web Accessibility Directive, allows the European Union to turn these into official legal requirements that its member states must abide. Even though member states can make adjustments, the Directive is a positive step toward creating and implementing uniform rules for online accessibility across the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Implementation and Timeline for the European Web Accessibility Directive</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Implementation of the Directive is well underway. As we look ahead to compliance deadlines, there are several dates to keep in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>September 23, 2019: All new websites (published after September 23, 2018) must be in compliance</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>September 23, 2020: Older sites (published before September 23, 2018) must be in compliance</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>June 23, 2021: Mobile applications must be in compliance</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>', 'post', 'active', 257, '2019-08-06 01:48:00', '2019-08-04 22:25:56', '2021-05-10 23:37:33', NULL, 'The European Web Accessibility Directive', 'The European Web Accessibility Directive', 'The European Web Accessibility Directive', 'ru', '<p><strong>The European Web Accessibility Directive</strong></p>'),

Developing countries remain to face issues of limited access to ICTs, little investments in ICTs infrastructure, lack of digital skills among others</strong>. At the same time, developing countries anticipate in digitalization potential improvement for the government, namely in embracing&nbsp; efficiency, increasing transparency and boosting citizens&rsquo; engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of e-government emerged in early 90th when governments began to use ICTs to complement their national and local governance systems. With different success, rank e-governments proved to be effective to increase the political participation of citizens, ensure efficient delivery of state services and even combat corruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, many early adopters of e-government made a significant mistake to neglect gender aspect as an integral part of e-government adoption.&nbsp; Understanding the structural causes of gender inequalities from the very start is crucial in order not to exacerbate existing gender gaps in governance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What gender issues may affect e-governance?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, women are less politically engaged than men. While there is little difference in voting participation of women and men in most countries, women are much less represented in political institutions. E-government and e-democracy tools such as e-petitions can engage more women into decision-making if they are well-informed about such opportunities and have access to them(). In addition, gender-responsive public services remain to be an issue for women all over the world. It is important to ensure that new digital services are gender-responsive meaning that everyone can have access and benefit from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, women are economically disadvantaged. Precarious jobs, unpaid care work, gender pay gap mean that women may end up becoming poorer than men. Their economic capacity and traditional role in families which usually requires committing unpaid housework do not leave room for actively using ICTs to engage with government. Furthermore, the poorest families may not even have access to the Internet to receive digital services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above mentioned issues affect women everywhere but the extent to which women in developing countries are being affected is larger and more evident. Thus, it is crucial to take them into account when designing governance systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the solutions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One concrete way to address these issues is to guarantee that e-governance initiatives are co-designed by citizens. Most national e-government platforms were designed in a top-down way based on little or no feedback from citizens. Therefore, existing e-government platforms are heavy on e-administration and poorly address e-services especially those provided to marginalized groups. E-democracy tools such as e-consultations or e-petitions are often also designed in the way that women are not informed or trained to use them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The assessment of socio-economic needs of men and women, the way they interact and the network is important to ensure gender-inclusive e-governance. Since women are outnumbered by men in strategic consultations and committees which design policies, specific efforts should be directed at including women&rsquo;s voices into those processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to address women&rsquo;s inclusion to e-government is to increase their digital literacy and inform about the benefits and opportunities of digital engagement with the government. At the same time, one cannot overlook the structural causes of gender inequality such as unpaid care work, which leaves no time and financial capacity for women to access ICTs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To sum up, e-governance offers innovative ways to address inequalities, including those between women and men. Not only it offers a more convenient way to interact with state authorities but also provides opportunities for citizen&rsquo;s engagement into decision-making processes. Women should be an integral part of those processes to ensure gender equality in developing countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>', 'post', 'active', 299, '2019-11-28 10:46:00', '2019-11-28 10:46:42', '2021-05-11 05:24:24', 4, NULL, NULL, '#egovernment #womenrights #ICT', 'ru', '<p><strong>Despite the overarching ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) deployment in the world all the countries differently experience its development and maintenance.

The biggest challenges faced by developing countries in the digital sector are digital divide, affordability and limited access to digital services and internet, absence of digital infrastructure and low-quality of education which makes it hard to compete in this digital era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The value of internet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internet is a basic need for human development in 21 century and should be accessible to everyone. Internet has the capacity to improve existing healthcare and education services, contribute to raising awareness on human rights issues, enhance accountability and transparency of government, support community development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increase of the internet penetration to 75% of the population in all developing countries (from 35% currently) would add US$2 trillion to GDP and create more than 140 million jobs worldwide (World Bank, 2019). It is also important to make sure that broadband access is expanded equally in cities and rural areas as digital divide remains one of the biggest challenges of digital development both in developed and developing countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connectivity and affordability are key for efficient public services and emerging jobs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last decade the number of internet users has grown from 1 billion in 2005 to 4, 4 billion in 2019. However, while the broadband prices are decreasing globally, developing countries are struggling to afford broadband subscriptions, especially in Least Developed countries and Small Island Developing countries. For example, only 30% of people in Africa have mobile broadband subscription and 15% are connected to the internet at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boosting connectivity through increasing access and affordability is essential for disruptive innovations in developing countries. Connectivity links consumers to businesses but also enables innovators to share ideas and seek funding and advice through the shared economy. Connectivity also helps governments to provide social services including education and healthcare in a more efficient and sometimes only possible manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, internet is powering many smart technologies including in infrastructure, engineering and services delivery. It is creating new jobs and is helping to develop emerging job skills, which may become a source of revenue for those living in poverty. Freelance and other outsourcing platforms are already very popular in developing countries as they value skills and cost over status or prestigious education. Faster and more affordable broadband can help to expand these platforms which are expected to provide millions of jobs according to different estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strengthening trust and combatting corruption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICTs can support anticorruption efforts in different ways. Many studies have proven its efficiency in ensuring accountability and transparency of governments as well as boosting civic participation. For example, by enhancing the access to public information citizens can better scrutinize public spending and report suspicious information. From the other hand, emerging technologies can provide new corruption opportunities through, for example darkweb or bags in the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, majority of studies in e-government very positive about its impact on government&rsquo;s efficiency and corruption fighting. One of the most promising emerging technologies which has the capacity to reduce corruption in public sector is blockchain. It has been applied in Africa to trace diamond trade deals, in Eastern Europe to register public data and track tax avoidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another promising innovation which can contribute to corruption fighting is Artificial Intelligence. For instance, AI has the ability to detect flaws in financial transaction data, taxes and budgets. However, lack of scientific evidences and current state of development of AI make it difficult to assess its potential in combating corruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While these emerging technologies have a great potential to fight corruption, they cannot do it alone. Therefore, to be effective, their implementation needs to be embedded in broader reforms of public administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Healthcare and crisis prevention</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limited access to healthcare is another challenge faced by developing countries, especially those with the highest number of people living behind the poverty line. New technologies cannot solve all issues related to healthcare but could help to overcome some traditional barriers such as access to remote community, awareness on basic health services etc. For example, there are drones which can detect potential viruses and epidemics in remote areas, Mobile Apps which are able to perform some basic examination of patients or report on medicine stocks around the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disruptive technologies are not only aimed at making people&rsquo;s lives easier but also ensuring basic conditions for life where it is necessary. At the same time, we cannot neglect the importance of traditional healthcare infrastructure and doctors which remain the primary source of healthcare and cannot be substituted by newest digital solutions and smart Apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Education and innovations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While more and more children around the globe are receiving access to primary education, in some parts of the world access to primary education remains a challenge. Today, 32,6 million children of primary-school age and 25,7 million adolescents are not going to school in sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2019). The quality of primary and secondary education also remains an issue. Digital solutions can provide some additional resources to traditional teaching though mobile and online channels. Advocates of digital education argue that the quality of digital education sources is often higher than qualification of teachers in the poorest countries. Also, it is cheaper to sustain a school without or with very few teachers. From the other hand, multiple researches on primary education are stressing that there is no digital solution which would substitute a teacher and states should take full responsibility for providing traditional public education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is recommended in this paper, that any decision involving public education should be taken according to particular needs in different countries and regions. Digital technologies could indeed improve the quality of education in developing countries but they should remain a part of the solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>New disruptive technologies have a great potential in fighting poverty and other societal issues faced by developing countries. There is a number of successful cases when technologies benefited job market, public services and governments&rsquo; transparency all over the world. While we need to continue exploring the social value of digital and tech innovations it is important to keep in mind that technologies alone cannot solve biggest world&rsquo;s social and economic challenges.</p>', 'post', 'active', 299, '2019-12-01 02:47:00', '2019-12-01 02:47:34', '2021-05-11 02:48:49', 4, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'ru', '<p>The value of internet</p>');

ICT technologies can benefit sustainable development and inclusive growth by reducing poverty, empowering the most vulnerable people and fighting inequalities. Digital technologies also proved to be effective in combating corruption and enhancing transparency and accountability. However, the wide use of digital technologies requires connectivity and affordability of digital tools and services, good level of digital skills and smart investments which would ensure the modernization of economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries which belong to the Eastern Partnership program, which was launched in 2009 by the EU, namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine have recently identified digital transformation as one of priority areas of cooperation with the EU. Digital economy has yet untapped potential for the EU and EaP countries to boost social and economic development as well as contribute to social justice. Сurrently, the EU and EaP countries are holding negotiations on strengthening cooperation within the Digital Single Market to boost digital trade. There is also a number of joint efforts on cyber security and common projects on ICT innovations and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The state of play on innovative economy in the EaP countries and the role of the EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastern Partnership countries declared the ambition to transform their economies into innovation-driven and knowledge-based. Some of them have adopted respective strategies and legislation (Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) and others launched ambitious digital programs such as eGovernment in Belarus and Azerbaijan. While EaP countries have great potential to build innovative economies, the strategic vision of innovative development which would harness that potential remains the biggest challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ICT Innovations and cyber security</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovative&nbsp;development and internet security are crucial for innovative economies. EaP countries do not have strong regulatory and legal frameworks on ICT innovations, internet and cyber security. However, all of the governments in the region are showing interest in fostering ICT innovations and legal framework will be a part of that process. Currently, the challenges in this include shortage of financial, technical and human resources to manage cyber security threats and personal data breaches. There are existent vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure connected to internet both in public and private sectors. Some of these risks are being addresses by the Association Agreement which the EU signed with the three countries in the region &ndash; Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine. Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan are working with the EU on those issues bilaterally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Electronic identification and E-Government</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are important components which enable the Digital Single Market in the EU. EaP countries are showing strong leadership on introducing e-identification and strengthening e-government technologies. For example, Moldova and Azerbaijan are using mobile identification services, some of such technologies are also being introduced in Ukraine. Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan and Ukraine are implementing Estonian X-Road E-Government system which provides interoperability and security of different government databases. The challenges within this area include weak legislation and slow bureaucratic procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connectivity and telecom rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average broadband penetration in the EaP countries is much lower than in the EU. This gap is particularly large in rural areas. For example, mobile broadband penetration per capita is 21% comparing to 61% in the EU. Neither of EaP countries have developed a consistent policy for universal access to high speed broadband. On the contrary, Digital Agenda of the European Union aims to provide universal access to high speed broadband for EU citizens by 2020. The EU&rsquo;s experience in putting forward policies that enabled investments in broadband can be crucial for the EaP countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>eCustoms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This initiative aims to substitute paper procedures at customs in order to increase transparency and fight corruption. While at the legislative level EaP countries have achieved a substantial progress to contribute to the paperless environment for customs and trade, little has been done to implement key information services such us identification and registration of authorized economic partners. Also, the electronic customs and single window systems are not interoperable with the ones in the EU. Another important part for enabling eCustoms is the Anti-Counterfeiting and Anti-Piracy systems which can be shared by the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>eCommerce for SMEs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-Commerce has been identified as one the first priority areas of the EU-EaP cooperation in the digital sector. This area of digital cooperation is by far the most advanced as EaP countries have harmonized almost half of required legislation to enable trading of products and services through the internet. However, the remaining obstacles such as little internet security and privacy as well weak consumer rights protection hinder the free movement of information society services. None of the EaP countries established online dispute resolution system for e-commerce customers. At the moment, the EU is looking at setting up a pilot eCommerce platform that would assist SMEs from EaP countries to engage in e-commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digital Skills</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital Skills are essential for enabling digital transformation of the society and economy. Both the EU and EaP countries are facing the digital skills gap which is exemplified by shortage of ICT specialists and absence of basic IT skills in large parts of population. While the digital skills gap is the EU is as high as 40%, there is no official statistics on the situation in the EaP countries. There are few Digital Skills initiatives supported by the EU in the region but there are no quick and short-term solutions to such a systemic issue. The development of digital skills requires coordinated policy approach in education and training sector, competitiveness, employment and social policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next steps of the EU and EaP cooperation: EU4Digital</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the EU and EaP countries are interested to harmonize digital environments between each other in order to boost digital cooperation. Such cooperation will increase digital trade, ensure the timely provision of e-services, enable common approaches to cyber security, bridging digital divide and create more jobs in the digital sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To this end, the European Union launched an ambitious multilateral project EU4Digital which aims to support digital development in EaP countries by:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;achieving a common roaming space among Eastern Partner countries by 2020</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;supporting cross-border digital trade in order to simplify export procedures and provide transparency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;enabling supportive environments for ICT innovations and start-ups</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;contributing to educational and training programmes to boost digital skills</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;ensuring common cyber security space between the EU and EaP countries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;sharing experience on implementing e-Health procedures</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project will run from 2019 till 2021 and its budget is EUR 11 million for 6 EaP countries. The first results of the project will be reported in the beginning of 2020 and will show to which extent the region is ready to integrate to the EU Digital Single Market and contribute to European innovative economy. This first phase reporting of the project will also allow for broader engagement of stakeholders and interested parties to influence the project&rsquo;s plans and outcomes in the next years of the duration of the project.</p>', 'post', 'active', 284, '2019-12-01 02:58:00', '2019-12-01 02:58:26', '2021-05-10 21:33:39', 4, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'ru', '<p>&nbsp;How the EU can contribute to supporting innovative economies in the Eastern Neighbourgood?&nbsp;</p>'),

The Code of Practice was issued to prevent and resolve threads of disinformation. As the European Parliament elections took place in May, the European Commission conducted monitoring the progress of the platforms towards meeting the commitments. In this situation, it is necessary to emphasize that signatories took part in the Code of Practice voluntarily.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So what the changes were and did we noticed anything?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In simple words, the EU worked with online platforms and industry to increase the transparency of political communications and prevent the manipulative use of their services to ensure users know why they see specific political content and ads, where they come from and who is behind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably a lot of you have noticed posts of Facebook where you could see they were &ldquo;Sponsored&rdquo; and as well could see by whom they were sponsored. This is one of the examples of how the Code of Practice was implemented.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s come closer to improvements that those famous networks made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Facebook</strong>: This social network started the whole campaign on preventing fake accounts by blocking accounts from being created; removing accounts at sign up when they show signs of malicious behavior; removing existing accounts that exhibit signs of malicious behavior. As well Facebook started notifying users when they share content that was fact-checked and rated as &ldquo;false&rdquo; or &ldquo;mixture&rdquo;, including enhanced warnings for false photos and video; providing explanatory articles alongside fact-checked content; making it easier for users to view information, via a Context Button, about websites and publishers they see on Facebook. And as it has been already mentioned in this article from March 2019 political ads on Facebook and Instagram must be labeled with a &ldquo;Paid for by&rdquo; disclaimer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Google</strong>: From March 2019 Google applied a policy to election ads that require verification and in-ad &ldquo;paid for by&rdquo; disclosures for all EU election ads as well as verification of advertisers running election ads (checking their eligibility to run election ads, their identity and citizenship). YouTube started to surface content from authoritative sources on its Breaking News and Top News Shelves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong>: For the time before and during the elections Twitter used political ads policy for the EU elections which is a certification process, which requires that political advertisers be established in the EU in order to place political ads in any EU Member State. As well Twitter applied Advertising Policy which prohibits the promotion of certain broad categories of content including hateful content, illegal products and services atc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those were most visible changes the user could notice.

Marked by recent successes such as the implementation of the e-procurement service ProZorro, the creation of one of the biggest 4G network of Europe and the introduction of several eServices, the Ukrainian government is setting high standards in the field of digital transformation. Indeed, Ukraine&rsquo;s digitalisation is led by joint efforts from the state and business communities: digital industry is a bright spot in the Ukrainian economy and its IT is the most dynamic industry in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This digital and tech success is due to many factors.</strong> First, Ukraine has the 4th highest number of certified IT professionals in the world. Tech companies can benefit from a friendly start-up ecosystem and a highly educated and English-speaking workforce. In addition, low taxes, affordable infrastructure and relatively cheap labour enable national and international companies to maximise their incomes. In the last few years Ukraine has increasingly attracted IT foreign investors: 20% of the world&rsquo;s leading companies such as Microsoft, Samsung, Huawei and others opened their offices in the country. Moreover, the European Union has emphasized the need to integrate Ukraine into the Digital Single Market in order to strengthen EU-Ukrainian economic ties.&nbsp;Ukraine has already been involved in the Digital Single Market strategy. There are some joint plans in the area of eTrade and eCustoms. Also, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement which the EU has concluded with Ukraine in 2014, provides a good basis for deepening digital cooperation between Ukraine and the EU.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>While Ukraine is doing relatively well in the field of digital and tech, it is not a secret that EU is experiencing some issues in this sector.</strong> European companies are often behind the American and Chinese digital and tech industries. Thus, the new European Commission has emphasized the need to tackle the EU&rsquo;s loss of competitiveness against US and Chines tech companies. As of today, only a few EU countries can effectively benefit from a strong and stable IT industry and many new and old member states still struggle to attract international investments in digital and tech sectors. Moreover, the debate on the Digital Tax and the new corporate tax rules&nbsp;for IT companies will certainly influence the long-term strategy of big tech companies within the EU. Countries such as France, Italy and Belgium want to limit the tech giants&#39; ability to avoid taxes.&nbsp;They argue that taxes should be based on where the digital activity takes place, not in the country where companies have their headquarters or operational centres.&nbsp;As the debate on taxation of digital and tech giants is a hot topic of EU politics, it is expected to have an impact on the future development of Ukrainian digital market and its integration with the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is likely that the implementation of new digital taxes within the EU would result in a massive&nbsp;relocation of IT&rsquo;s investments and business processes in Europe. And Ukraine can be a potential destination for such offshoring.&nbsp;To date, Ukrainian and Ukrainian-based IT firms compete with neighbouring European countries including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania. Compared to many EU member states, industry leaders currently see Ukraine as having key competitive advantages such as the state&rsquo;s flexible labour regulations and a simplified taxation regime. Moreover, in Ukraine the total number of people working in IT industry is larger than in most Eastern European countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly important for large projects requiring large teams of specialists. Also, Ukrainian professionals are ready to work under more severe contract terms, such as unusual shifts to support different time zones and longer hours. As the integration of Ukraine to the EU single market is increasing, international companies may find Ukraine more attractive for investments and business development than other EU countries. Cities such as Kyiv, Lviv or Odesa are indeed excellent location to both access the fast-growing Ukrainian market as well as sell products and services to the EU market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the era of growing debates on fair taxation and harmonised EU regulations for the digital sector, many EU governments could start to consider Ukraine as a potential tax heaven for digital companies working in the EU market. Thus, it is likely that IT offshoring will increasingly be a problem affecting the EU-Ukrainian relations. Ukrainian digital strengths can be seen as a potential threat by many EU states and companies. This can lead to possible political tensions between Kyiv and Brussels and slow down Ukraine&rsquo;s integration with the EU. Not to mention the risk of reducing the support to Ukrainian reforms from the EU budget which has been massive in the recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To avoid these negative trends both the EU and Ukraine should strengthen cooperation in the field of digital economy.</strong> In particular, the EU should start to benefit from the Ukrainian digital proximity and develop a long-term partnership in the field of digital and tech. First, the EU should facilitate the cooperation between European and Ukrainian IT companies. For instance, Ukraine is a perfect spot for European IT companies to produce high-value hardware and software which can make Europe a strong competitor of the US and China. To achieve this, Ukraine and the EU should agree on common principles related to transparency, resource mobilisation, data protection and privacy regulations in the digital and tech sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, Ukraine is a great source of expertise and experience in fighting cyber threats. In the recent years, the open warfare with Russia has caused large-scale attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and the government has often faced significant security challenges. As a consequence, the country is the perfect place to learn tactics and tools to fight cyber threats. As many cyber attacks targeting the EU member states were proved to be originated in Russia the European Commission should start to develop more common initiatives in the field of cyber security with Ukrainian partners. In particular, a permanent exchange of expertise and good practices on cyber security might be a central topic of the future Ukraine&rsquo;s European integration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Brussels manages to benefit from Ukrainian digital proximity, both Ukraine and the EU will strengthen economic and political ties. Strategic efforts in this area could boost Europe&rsquo;s comparative advantage in the global digital economy and reduce the gap with Chinese and American tech. However, this will certainly require a coherent European digital strategy and the support of the current Ukrainian government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things which can be complicated to get.&nbsp;</p>', 'post', 'active', 320, '2020-02-03 23:37:00', '2020-02-03 22:17:40', '2021-05-10 09:47:51', 4, 'e-government', NULL, NULL, 'ru', '<p>Ukraine is increasingly moving towards becoming one of the leaders&nbsp;on digital and tech in Eastern Europe.

While the reform has been successful in many areas the issues of inefficiency, abundant bureaucracy and lack of human-centered and innovative public administration on the local level have barely been addressed. Innovations is a proven tool to achieving better transparency, accountability, openness and efficiency of judiciary sector. One of the key provisions of the new Parliamentary reform Agenda is an Integration into global innovation ecosystem.&nbsp;The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted the Concept of Development of the Digital Economy and Society of Ukraine for 2018-2020 and approved the plan of measures for its implementation. One of the targets of the reform is to make the innovative transformation of the judicial system in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reducing of a delay, improving economy, efficiency and effectiveness and the more general objective of promoting confidence in the justice system using new technologies &lsquo;are laudable aims and are unlikely to generate much dissention&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of information and communication technology (ICT) is considered one of the key elements to significantly improve the administration of justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rapid development of technology opens up new opportunities that were unthinkable only a few years ago in Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, given the nature and importance of the judiciary as the third pillar of the State authority, and compared to other public services, due process, impartiality and independence should also be carefully taken into account. This is especially so when structural and procedural changes, such as the ones driven by the introduction of the new technologies, take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, artificial intelligence is a challenge and a new way to the transformation of the legal profession.&nbsp;It progressively changing legal practice and institutions and the nature of law and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative uses of digital platforms is providing new possibilities in dispute resolution, legal registries and private law orderings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_heading=h.cpik6djmyai1\"></a>With the surveys done by the European Commission on the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ), we can learn about IT implementation in courts in Europe. Finland, Austria and the United Kingdom, but also Estonia, Slovakia and Hungary, are in the very high implementation group. High levels of implementation can be found in France, Germany, Sweden, Latvia, Bulgaria and the Netherlands. Belgium, Ireland and Croatia are in the moderate level group. Unfortunately, in the low-level group the survey finds Cyprus and Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_heading=h.85zd5rpnuuqx\"></a>On its way to Euro- Integration, Ukraine should follow the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine and borrow the best practices, concerning Judicial reforms from European countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;The diversity of institutional settings within Europe provides contrasting examples of the use of technology to support the administration of justice. The variety of solutions adopted, both from a technical and managerial point of view, provides a unique insight into judicial applications of ICT and these solutions should be disseminated and discussed in-depth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI can scrutinize arbitral award in a timely manner to maximize its chances of recognition and enforcement. For example, AI can ensure that the arbitral tribunal has complied with the procedural format required for the award. AI can also ascertain that the arbitral tribunal has answered every issue raised by the parties in their submissions. Additionally, AI can help the arbitrators with assessing the compliance of the award with mandatory rules and public policy of the seat of arbitration or potential places of enforcement of the award to comply with their duty to render an enforceable award.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arbitral process is only completed upon the successful enforcement of the award by the winning party. The enforcement of the award can become complicated but at the same time the enforcement of awards is one of the main advantages of international commercial arbitration over international litigation .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An arbitration award extinguishes the cause of action in respect of which the arbitration proceedings were commenced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the enforcement of the award that gives the bite and legitimacy to the arbitral proceeding. The successful party has a legitimate expectation that the award be performed without delay.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failing which, the enforcing court plays an important role in this process. Due to a variety of approaches existing in different countries, enforcement stage often lasts even longer than arbitration itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Convention obliges contracting parties where applicable under the said Convention to recognize and enforce an international arbitration award made in foreign state, provided it is in compliance with terms set out in Articles I to V of the New York Convention which relate to issues including (1) valid and enforceable arbitration agreements; (2) disputes; (3) arbitrability; and (4) the grounds on which the respondent can rely to refuse recognition and enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Timely objections are often an issue that surfaces up during the enforcement stage, held that the argument that the award of money under related agreements was not based on a valid arbitration agreement could not be raised at this stage as no objection to jurisdiction had been raised before the arbitrators.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_heading=h.gjdgxs\"></a><a name=\"_heading=h.p5p4umo1idim\"></a>Another direction that ICT investments have taken is the development of sentencing support and automated judgment systems.

A more integrated design is required. And this is exactly what citizens&rsquo; assemblies offer.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In modern democracies the predominant mode of citizen contribution to politics is electing representatives to develop policies for them. This constitutes the core of representative democracy. However, too often the interposition of personal and party interests, the disconnection of politicians from their constituents, and the consequent elitism and the lack of trust towards the government undermine electoral democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practice, representative politics is supplemented by professional policy development by learned experts be they civic servants or extramural consultants effectively constructing an expertocracy. Although such specialists might possess a more comprehensive perspectives on policy issues, they are not directly elected by the people. This might put in question the legitimacy of their policy proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, grassroots activism expressed in signing petitions, participating in strikes, boycotts, demonstrations, protests, and other forms of political action re-links the people to policy making. These efforts reflect the idea of direct democracy. Yet, such outright activities bear the risks of insufficient expertise, representation and power imbalances, and of falling into particularistic interests at the expense of those serving community or society as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When these activities employ information and communication technologies, they also embody digital democracy. It allows a wider, faster, and more inclusive involvement. Albeit, public opinion is especially susceptible to manipulation online, while e-participation raises cyber-security concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, how to combine direct citizen participation with an inclusive, informed, and reflective policy making? An alternative solution is to apply randomocracy or sortive democracy design. It is similar to the sortition procedure practiced in ancient Athens for choosing representatives for public offices and to the random selection of jurors to serve on a jury during a jury trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary citizens&rsquo; assemblies are mini-publics inspired by earlier experiments such as citizens&rsquo; juries, planning cells, consensus conferences <a href=\"#1\">[1]</a>, deliberative polling <a href=\"#2\">[2]</a>, and other formats of deliberative democracy <a href=\"#3\">[3]</a>. Although their designs vary, they are usually united by a set of common principles and procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with an important yet contested policy requiring a wide and profound discussion, trust and legitimation by the public, policy makers would call a citizens&rsquo; assembly. It would be composed of a group of over 100 individuals drawn using a random sample (according to statistics, supposed to represent the whole population best). Furthermore, a reputable and impartial organising committee would assemble the selected citizens, assist in studying an issue, hearings of experts, and facilitate in-person critical deliberation in small groups. As a result, the participants are supposed to form an opinion, develop, and vote on policy recommendations. To ensure transparency and wider public opinion formation, the discussions would be broadcast on mass media. The final recommendations would be put for voting on a referendum or sent to policy makers for review and adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europe and North America hold most citizens</strong><strong>&rsquo;</strong> <strong> assemblies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizens&rsquo; assemblies have been practised on all continents, although mostly in Northern America and Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first ever case took place in 2004 in British Columbia <a href=\"#4\">[4]</a>. At that time, the provincial electoral system had clear shortcomings. The number of seats each political party gained in the Legislative Assembly was determined not by popular vote, but by results by each riding (district). Consequently, in the 1996 election one party gained the majority of the popular vote, but another party gained the majority of the seats. Further, in the 2001 election parties with considerable popular vote support gained few or no seats at all, while one party with 57.6% of popular vote gained 97.5% of seats. Apparently, such electoral system posed serious political risks to the parties. Eventually, politicians proposed that the citizens debate and decide on a new electoral system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>160 British Columbians randomly selected from all province&#39;s electoral districts constituted the independent and non-partisan Assembly. They deliberated is small groups and in plenary sessions. The session recordings were broadcasted on television. Besides, the public discussed the matter and provided inputs online. In total, there were 1,603 written submissions. The Assembly scrutinized the existing electoral system, looked for alternatives, and suggested a proportional system. The recommendations were widely disseminated and passed to a referendum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the referendum, in 77 of 79 electoral districts a simple majority of voters supported these recommendations. This comprised 57.7% votes in favour. However, this was less than the required super-majority of votes (60% popular support of voters and simple majorities in 60% of all ridings). Therefore, the new electoral system was not adopted. Nevertheless, this experiment inspired other citizens&rsquo; assemblies around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in 2013, citizens&rsquo; assembly (<em>Rahvakogu</em>) was launched in Estonia <a href=\"#5\">[5]</a>. In the previous 2012 year the country faced a political party funding scandal, which spurred mass protests and a widely supported e-petition. The president called a meeting with CSOs and soon after an initiative group of CSOs and parties designed the assembly. Despite parliament&rsquo;s scepticism, the initiative group urged a deliberative democracy exercise to resolve the crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole process attracted a significant media attention. Online crowdsourcing by 2,000 registered users brought around 6,000 proposals. The initiators grouped them into sub-categories, experts commented, then authors and experts discussed and voted offline. A representative for the whole society sample of 300 was brought for an informed offline deliberation and voting. The resulting policy proposal document was published online. A total of 15 proposals of 6 topics in a report were passed to the parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As many as 7 proposals (46.7% of all submitted) were adopted by the parliament. In particular, party funding became subject to higher scrutiny. Also, the threshold to register a party was lowered twofold to 500 members. A new law introduced the possibility of submitting e-petitions and obliged the parliament to consider requests gathering at least 1,000 signatures. The very public debate served the role of civic education for participants and adherents, who became more informed and active. This democratic method was tested, proved to be efficient, and paved the path to further assemblies in 2017, 2018, and 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizens&rsquo; assemblies had a profound effect on policy making in Ireland <a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>. After the 2010 economic crisis Irish politicians were eager to engage citizens and promised this in public. So, in 2012-2014 scholars and the government experimented with the Convention on the Constitution. Further, in 2016-2018 due to a political division about controversial and sensitive policy issues the government called for Citizens&rsquo; Assembly (<em>Thion&oacute;l Saor&aacute;nach</em> in Irish).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012-2014 randomly selected 66 citizens were mixed with 33 politicians. The participants chose, studied, and debated on 9 topics. These concerned reducing the voting age and the presidential term, the role of women, same sex marriage, electoral reform, blasphemy, constitutional amendments, parliamentary reform, and on economic, social and cultural rights. They produced respective reports, which were addressed by the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of these issues were put for referendums in 2015. And although one referendum did not approve lowering the age threshold for presidential candidacy, a majority of 62.1% in another one did approve the marriage equality, which soon was signed into law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016-2018 a total of 99 citizens were randomly selected. The government defined the topics, namely on abortion, ageing population, fixed-term parliaments, referenda format, and climate change. The public provided a formidable number of inputs, 9,614 of 14,631 which (66%) were online. Experts selected some of these, summarised and presented them. The citizens deliberated and voted offline, while mass media live streamed the sessions. As a result, the secretariat drafted policy proposals, the government reviewed them and passed to the parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2018 referendum with 66.4% of votes repealed the Eighth Amendment thereby introducing a more universal right for abortion soon signed into law by a respective bill. It is remarkable that the deliberation design provided a safe environment for such a controversial topic allowing an overall rational and polite discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As humanity is facing global environmental risks, a series of climate change citizens&rsquo; assemblies are being held. Starting with the Irish 2017 deliberation on tackling climate change, similar public debates followed in other countries. In 2019 the United Kingdom called the Climate Assembly <a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>. In the same year, Estonia launched the Forestry Assembly <a href=\"#8\">[8]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to introduce a successful citizen assembly</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although citizens&rsquo; assemblies are so empowering and useful for policy making, they are not widespread. So, what preconditions increase the chances of their establishment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, the commitment to democratic values among population in general plays a significant role. According to the scholar of an early United States&rsquo; case, as Oregon was the first US state to run the initiative in elections, locals understood themselves as pioneers in democracy <a href=\"#9\">[9]</a>. Charismatic Individual political leaders can promote randomocracy projects too. As the British Columbia citizens&rsquo; assembly project coordinator recognised: &ldquo;there was a leader, who wanted to champion the project &ndash; the Premier of British Columbia at that time Gordon Gibson&rdquo; <a href=\"#10\">[10]</a>. Specific objectives of partisan politics can situationally coincide with randomocracy model. &ldquo;In the Canadian case of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, a party used the deliberative process as an effective campaign pledge that it was willing to deliver once voted into office&rdquo; <a href=\"#11\">[11]</a>. In sum, when popular demand for direct participation is supported by political powers under favourable pollical circumstances, ideas become real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering that some citizens&rsquo; assemblies have little effect, while others promote massive civic engagement and initiate legislative change, what makes citizens&rsquo; assemblies successful in terms of policy impact and democratic action?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely, a protest movement countering a political crisis can draw considerable attention and bring media visibility to the new participatory initiative. Scholars highlight that in Estonia political problems and low trust towards the political establishment put political parties under pressure and scrutiny <a href=\"#12\">[12]</a>. A member of the organising committee admitted that there was a plenty of public interest and background advocacy <a href=\"#13\">[13]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, political will was critical too. According to another member of the organising committee, the parties had to deal with the civic initiatives, because the President told them <a href=\"#14\">[14]</a>. As emphasized by the civil society adviser to the President of Estonia: &ldquo;the key success factor for similar processes is the commitment of policymakers to respecting the outcomes of the consultations&hellip; first and foremost showing appreciation of the time and energy the participants have put into the process by working with the input in a timely manner and giving proper feedback to the public <a href=\"#15\">[15]</a>. A researcher of Estonia&rsquo;s case recognised that a new interesting and valuable instrument of civic participation was created and worked afterwards <a href=\"#16\">[16]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the procedural viewpoint, it is essential to develop a balanced design, arrange a diligent and transparent process, and bring it to the result. The advocate of citizens&rsquo; assembly in Ireland narrated that they applied grant funding for deliberation experimenting and campaigning for a more participatory policy making, which they improved with every next assembly <a href=\"#17\">[17]</a>. Further, as an academic support group member appraised, a right secretariat was chosen and the consultation was run very well <a href=\"#18\">[18]</a>. The Irish Constitutional Convention Secretary reflected that the citizens&rsquo; assembly model has been a success because it provided a safe and fair environment for a rational and polite discussion, where people made their considerations on complex and sensitive issues, which were accepted at the referendum <a href=\"#19\">[19]</a>. A civic activist pointed out that the Irish referendum showed support of policy proposals due to a systematic campaigning, advocacy, and lobbying although he acknowledged that during the citizens&rsquo; assembly efforts were made that all perspectives were heard <a href=\"#20\">[20]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core strength of citizens&rsquo; assembly lies in a combination of policy making models. As well as in the Canadian example, the Irish case linked deliberative democracy (mini-publics) and direct democracy (referenda) <a href=\"#21\">[21]</a>. Both Irish and Estonian assemblies employed direct democracy and digital democracy (offline and online crowdsourcing) for collecting policy proposals from the public. In all the three instances these were further strengthened by expertocracy (professional informing and moderation) and carried over for representative democracy (law-making by the parliament).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eight conditions, including democratic values and political will, affect the implementation of citizens assemblies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As citizens&rsquo; assemblies are evidently desirable and powerful initiatives, it is worth taking into account that their success as measured by policy impact and democratic participation depends on a set of conditions. First of all, the scale of initial problem and its recognition by key stakeholders matters. In all three cases there was a political crisis, which was voiced by the public and was difficult to be resolved by conventional means of representative democracy. Therefore, there was a clear demand for change. Second, there was a critical mass of democratically-minded stakeholders that indicated the capacity of civil society and authorities. Decision makers in power were open to new public input formats, civic activists were eager to step in, and funds from multiple sources were allocated. Third, the participatory design and the openness to experiment that shaped the democraticness of an initiative were essential. Fourth, the clarity of civic engagement message and its communication coverage raised awareness about participation opportunities. Across these cases there was broadcasting of the deliberation process to the wider public and in two most influential ones there was an initial offline and online ideas crowdsourcing stage. Fifth, the democratic delivery and transparency during implementation ensured procedural scrutiny and clarity. Sixth, in one case the clarity of the message about outcomes and its media coverage provided a proper communication of results. Seventh, the scope of the established institutions and their mandate resulted in the institutionalization of the initiated democratic format.

It fell short of providing its citizens access to information, commitment to public accountability, and space for civic participation.<a href=\"#1\">[1]</a> On the contrary, as reported by Freedom House, Belarus government is consistently restricting civil liberties and corrupting elections.<a href=\"#1\">[2]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2020 presidential election was the chance for the people of Belarus to express their democractic will. However, the elections failed to meet international standards, especially considering that major oppositional leaders were denied of registration as presidential candidates and arrested, while independent observers were detained after documenting numerous violations of the election law.<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a> Moreover, citizens of Belarus were deprived of a proper access to the internet before, during, and after the elections, which violated their right to information. The elections have been evaluated by the Council of the European Union as neither free nor fair; moreover, state authorities deployed disproportionate and unacceptable violence further suppressing the freedoms of assembly, media and expression.<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a> These severe measures have seriously undermined the legitimacy and competency of country leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the last days, people of Belarus massively strike and protest.<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a> The demonstrators demand to release political detainees and prisoners, abolish mass media censorship, denounce the questionable election results, to resign Mr. Alexandr Lukashenko, and conduct free re-elections. This creates an unprecedented opportunity to reform the country in general and public administration in particular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under these circumstances the European Digital Development Alliance expresses support for the democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus and calls the European Union to support Belarusian civil society and facilitate a genuine and inclusive dialogue between the public and the government. We also believe that the EU should initiate an international mission under the auspices of the UN or OSCE to mediate the crises and monitor human rights violations in Belarus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the future, we will be delighted to see Belarus as a member state the Council of Europe<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a> &ndash; striving to strengthen human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, as well as a national member of the Open Governance Partnership<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a> &ndash; aiming to make the government more accessible, responsive, and accountable to citizens. Supporting such endeavours, EDDA can provide recommendations to the to-be-elected president, the to-be-appointed government, and civil society organisations of Belarus regarding policies and practices of initiating and sustaining profound reforms for a more open, innovative, and responsive government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Заява European Digital Development Alliance аб сітуацыі ў Рэспубліцы Беларусь</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>На працягу апошніх гадоў урад Беларусі дэманстраваў відавочны недахоп адкрытага да супрацы, і, адпаведна, эфектыўнага кіравання. Урад не забяспечыў сваім грамадзянам неабходны доступ да інфармацыі, не праявіў належнай прыхільнасці да публічнай справаздачы і не стварыў дастатковай прасторы для грамадзянскага ўдзелу<a href=\"#1\">[1]</a>. Наадварот, паводле справаздачы Freedom House, урад Беларусі паслядоўна абмяжоўвае грамадзянскія правы, умешваецца ў выбачы працэс і фальсiфiкуе вынікі<a href=\"#2\">[2]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Прэзідэнцкія выбары 2020 году былі магчымасцю для народа Беларусі выказаць сваю дэмакратычную волю. Але гэтыя выбары зусім не адпавядалі міжнародным стандартам, асабліва прымаючы да ўвагі тое, што вядучыя лідары апазіцыі не былі зарэгістраваны як кандыдаты ў прэзідэнты і былі арыштаваны, у той момант незалежныя назіральнікі былі затрыманы пасля таго, як зафіксавалі шматлікія парушэнні выбарчага заканадаўства<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a>. Больш за тое, грамадзяне Беларусі былі пазбаўленыя паўнавартаснага доступу да інтэрнэту да, падчас і пасля выбараў, што пазбавіла іх права на доступ да інфармацыі. Гэтыя выбары былі ацэнены Саветам Еўрапейскага Саюза як несвабодныя і несумленныя, таксама было адзначана, што ўлады ўжылі непрапарцыянальны і непрымальны ўзровень гвалту, які яшчэ больш заглушыў права на свабоду сходаў, свабоду сродкаў масавай інфармацыі і свабоду слова<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a>. Гэтыя жорсткія меры фактычна разбурылі легітымнасьць і паказалі некампетэнтнасць кіраўніцтва краіны.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>У гэтыя дні беларускі народ удзельнічае ў масавых забастоўках і акцыях пратэсту<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a>. Удзельнікі дэманстрацыі патрабуюць вызваліць палітычных зняволеных і вязняў, адмяніць цэнзуру сродкаў масавай інфармацыі, адмяніць сумнеўныя вынікі выбараў, адправіць у адстаўку Аляксандра Лукашэнку і правесці свабодныя перавыбары. Гэта стварае беспрэцэдэнтныя магчымасці рэфармавання краіны ў цэлым і дзяржаўнага кіравання ў прыватнасці.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>У гэтых абставінах European Digital Development Alliance (EDDA) выказвае падтрымку дэмакратычным імкненням народа Беларусі, заклікае Еўрапейскі Саюз падтрымаць беларускую грамадзянскую супольнасць і спрыяць сур&#39;ёзнаму шырокаму дыялогу паміж грамадскасцю і ўладамi. Мы таксама лічым, што ЕС варта выступіць з ініцыятывай міжнароднай місіі пад эгідай ААН або АБСЕ ў якасці пасярэднікаў для ўрэгулявання крызісу і маніторынгу парушэнняў правоў чалавека ў Беларусі.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>У будучыні мы будзем рады бачыць Беларусь у якасці дзяржавы-сябра Савета Еўропы<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>, якая будзе дамагацца абароны правоў чалавека, узмацнення дэмакратыі і ўмацавання вяршэнства закона, а таксама ў якасці нацыянальнага сябра Партнёрства &quot;Адкрыты Урад&quot;<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>, якое будзе імкнуцца зрабіць урад больш даступным, спагадным і падсправаздачным грамадзянам. З мэтай падтрымаць такія ініцыятывы, EDDA гатова распрацаваць рэкамендацыі для будучага прэзідэнта, урада і грамадзянскай супольнасці Беларусі адносна грамадзкіх палітык і практык нацэленых на запуск і падтрымку грунтоўных рэформ у напрамку больш адкрытага і інавацыйнага ўрада, якое адказвае на запыты грамадства.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Заявление European Digital Development Alliance о ситуации в Республике Беларусь</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>В течение последних лет правительство Беларуси демонстрировало явную нехватку открытого, сотрудничающего и, соответственно, эффективного управления. Правительство не обеспечило своим гражданам необходимый доступ к информации, не проявило должной приверженности к публичной отчетности, и не создало достаточного пространства для гражданского участия<a href=\"#1\">[1]</a>. Напротив, согласно отчету Freedom House, правительство Беларуси последовательно ограничивает гражданские права и вмешивается в процесс и искажает результаты выборов<a href=\"#2\">[2]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Президентские выборы 2020 года были возможностью для народа Беларуси выразить свою демократическую волю. Но эти выборы совсем не соответствовали международным стандартам, особенно принимая во внимание то, что ведущие лидеры оппозиции не были зарегистрированы как кандидаты в президенты и были арестованы, а независимые наблюдатели были задержаны после того, как зафиксировали многочисленные нарушения избирательного законодательства<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a>. Более того, граждане Беларуси были лишены полноценного доступа к интернету до, во время и после выборов, что лишило их права на доступ к информации. Эти выборы были оценены Советом Европейского Союза как несвободные и нечестные, также было отмечено, что власти применили непропорциональный и неприемлемый уровень насилия, которое еще больше подавило право на свободу собраний, свободу средств массовой информации и свободу слова<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a>. Эти жестокие меры фактически разрушили легитимность и показали некомпетентность руководства страны.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>В эти дни народ Беларуси массово принимает участие в забастовках и протестах<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a>. Участники демонстраций требуют освободить политических задержанных и заключенных, отменить цензуру средств массовой информации, отменить сомнительные результаты выборов, отправить в отставку Александра Лукашенко и провести свободные перевыборы. Это создает беспрецедентные возможности реформирования страны в целом и государственного управления в частности.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>В этих обстоятельствах European Digital Development Alliance (EDDA) выражает поддержку демократическим стремлениям народа Беларуси и призывает Европейский Союз поддержать беларусское гражданское общество и способствовать серьезному широкому диалогу между общественностю и властью. Мы также считаем, что ЕС стоит выступить с инициативой международной миссии под эгидой ООН или ОБСЕ в качестве посредников для урегулирования кризиса и мониторинга нарушений прав человека в Беларуси.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>В будущем мы будем рады видеть Беларусь в качестве государства-члена Совета Европы<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>, которое будет добиваться защиты прав человека, усиления демократии и укрепления верховенство закона, а также в качестве национального члена Партнерства &ldquo;Открытое Правительство&rdquo;<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>, которое будет стремиться сделать правительство более доступным, отзывчивым и подотчетным гражданам.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>С целью поддержать такие инициативы, EDDA готова разработать рекомендации для будущего президента, правительства и гражданского общества Беларуси относительно общественных политик и практик нацеленных на запуск и поддержку основательных реформ в направлении более открытого и инновационного правительства, которое отвечает на запросы общества.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/soeu-2019-0017\">https://doi.org/10.1515/soeu-2019-0017</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"2\" name=\"2\">[2]</a> <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/belarus/freedom-world/2020\">https://freedomhouse.org/country/belarus/freedom-world/2020</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"3\" name=\"3\">[3]</a> <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/independent-election-monitors-detained-in-belarus-during-early-voting/30767918.html\">https://www.rferl.org/a/independent-election-monitors-detained-in-belarus-during-early-voting/30767918.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"4\" name=\"4\">[4]</a> <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/08/11/belarus-declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-the-presidential-elections/\">https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/08/11/belarus-declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-the-presidential-elections/</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"5\" name=\"5\">[5]</a> <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/europe/hundreds-thousands-march-belarus\">https://www.voanews.com/europe/hundreds-thousands-march-belarus</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"6\" name=\"6\">[6]</a> <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal\">https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"7\" name=\"7\">[7]</a> <a href=\"https://www.opengovpartnership.org/\">https://www.opengovpartnership.org/</a></p>', 'post', 'active', 812, '2020-08-20 00:00:00', '2020-08-20 07:01:24', '2021-05-11 04:16:38', 19, 'Belarus, protests', NULL, NULL, 'ru', '<p><strong>European Digital Development Alliance statement on the affairs in the Republic of Belarus</strong></p>'),

This can create deeper, more intense, and more immersive educational experiences within a community of like-minded learners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can social learning support uptake of digital skills for an inclusive digital transformation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While social learning is being successfully used in organizations, having a huge impact on a number of core enterprise processes, including recruiting, onboarding, training and developing talent, it is important to replicate those models beyond the organizational structure, to the benefit of a larger part of the population.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aligned with the approach of this learning method, the Social Learning Community put in place by the Women Power Code project consortium aims at making digital subjects more attractive for women, by creating a virtual space where they can consult peers to gain information, discuss mutual interests and concerns about learning these topics. In the medium and long-term, the objective is to enable women to explore and share solutions to common professional dilemmas through action research, by developing resources, and/or implementing new instructional strategies. Additionally, it aims at building cooperation for creativity and innovation development among all the targeted stakeholders, including education providers, IT companies, Universities, Women Associations etc. from the IT field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://womenpowercode.eu/social-learning-community\">Women Power Code Social Learning Community</a>&nbsp;aims to offer a competitive advantage to those women who are part of the community, as they become aware and familiar with these online collaboration tools and are part of a support network where they discuss the challenges they encounter in their professions with other peers. Moreover, they develop the practical knowledge to be able to introduce this social learning method in different aspects of their life, including for potential employers, which represents a highly valued skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adopting a social learning approach both in the workplace and beyond will prove critical in developing resilient and sustainable communities, towards an inclusive digital transformation of our society.</p>', 'post', 'active', 420, '2020-08-30 15:40:54', '2020-08-30 12:40:54', '2021-05-10 10:30:57', 19, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'ru', '<p>To support women to navigate the rapid changes and ever-greater complexity of the digital society, the Women Power Code project consortium launched the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://womenpowercode.eu/social-learning-community\">Women Power Code Social Learning Community</a>&nbsp;aimed at making digital subjects more attractive for women, by creating a virtual space where they can consult peers to gain information, discuss mutual interests and concerns about learning these topics.

In recent years, the EU prioritised digital technology in its international development policy &ndash; as reflected in its Digital4Development approach and Digital Single Market initiative. However, as specific support for digitalisation is a relatively new part of the EU&rsquo;s foreign policy, the EU has only funded a small number of digital projects for development so far.

She and her fellow students were raising their voices against their lack of access to reliable and affordable internet services needed to participate in online learning. They were not alone: at the peak of the pandemic in April 2020, close to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/news/building-back-equal-addressing-gender-dimensions-covid-19-school-closures-through-technology\">450 million students</a>&nbsp;across the world did not have access to online learning options, with girls and women being most disadvantaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic fueled a digital transformation across the globe. Industries from education to health to commerce have moved into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/industries-tech-shaping-world-post-covid/\">digital spaces</a>. However, in most developing countries like Pakistan, the digital economy is not benefiting everyone equally. There are growing digital gaps and divides across regions (urban/rural) and between socioeconomic groups (gender/income/age), with women and girls lagging behind men in their access to connectivity and digital technologies. The&nbsp; GSMA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GSMA-Connected-Women-The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2019.pdf\">Mobile Gender Gap Report 2019</a>, for instance, showed that women in low and middle income countries are 10 per cent less likely than men to own a mobile phone, while 313 million fewer women than men use mobile internet. Without immediate action, this new digital divide will make existing gender inequalities even worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>EU&rsquo;s Digital4Development agenda</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Union (EU) has embarked on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/blogposts/digital4development-new-approach-eus-development-tool-kit\">Digital4Development</a>&nbsp;(D4D) strategy to mainstream digital technologies and services into its development policies. December 2020 marked two important milestones for the EU to support the digital transformation of the Global South. The first one is the approval of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2018%3A460%3AFIN\"><strong>NDICI Regulation</strong></a>&mdash;the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument, which will be used to provide funding to the EU&rsquo;s partner countries for poverty reduction and sustainable development, and to financially support the European Commission&rsquo;s priorities, one of which is digitalisation. The second one is the launch of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/partner/d4d-hub/\"><strong>Digital4Development (D4D) Hub</strong></a>&nbsp;as a global multi-stakeholder platform (currently focusing on Africa and soon expanding to Latin America and Caribbean and Asia and Pacific) for digital partnerships and investments, sending a clear signal that&nbsp;<em>the future of development cooperation is digital</em>. The question for the EU now is: how can it ensure that digital transformation is also&nbsp;<em>gender-inclusive</em>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before answering that question, the EU faces a major challenge in that some developing countries might not consider digitalisation and gender equality to be priorities. The EU still has a lot of work to do during the programming process of the NDICI to persuade developing countries that Digital4Development should be their priority for cooperation over the next seven years. Moreover, the EU recently released its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/system/files/join_2020_17_en_final.pdf\">Gender Action Plan III&nbsp;</a>(GAP 3), as per which 85 per cent of all new external actions will contribute to gender equality and women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; empowerment as a significant objective or as a principal objective by 2025. Developing countries might perceive both of these priorities as being imposed on them. The EU would need to engage in soft diplomacy with the partner countries to get them on board for a gender-equal digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Towards a feminist digital future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A feminist and intersectional perspective in EU&rsquo;s D4D policies can safeguard the rights and opportunities for women and girls (and minority groups) across the partner countries. The ambitious gender targets for the NDICI are already a good start. These should also be applied to development cooperation for digital transformation. The EU should take a two-dimensional approach to digital transformation in its development cooperation and investments in partner countries: as mainstreamed, but also as a single priority with an influence and opportunity to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/global-digital-agenda-5-steps-ensure-europe-becomes-soft-power-superpower-60650/\">pair digital development and human rights</a>, and more specifically rights for women and girls. The following key aspects should be taken into account to ensure that women and girls don&rsquo;t get left behind in the digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Women and girls as users</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/digital/bridging-the-digital-gender-divide.pdf\">root causes</a>, including the lack of affordability, awareness, education, and technical literacy, and in some regions, socio-cultural norms and biases that lead to gender-based digital exclusion, limit women&rsquo;s access to technology and connectivity in developing countries. Safety-based issues, such as the risk of cyber harassment, are also an important concern when it comes to women&rsquo;s access to the internet or ownership of mobile phones. Many of these gaps can be attributed to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apc.org/sites/default/files/FeministActionFrameworkOnDevelopmentAndDigitalTechnologies.pdf\">lack of gender-focused approach in national and global internet policies</a>. The EU can work with the partner countries to ensure that the internet is open, free and secure for everyone, and complement it with targeted skills development programmes for women and girls. At the same time, partner countries should ensure that they have policies and frameworks in place for women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; online safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Women and girls as economic agents</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital transformation results in new kinds of jobs that require new sets of skills, creating different opportunities and challenges for everyone. We should assess the impact of digitalisation on labour markets in developing countries through a gendered perspective, to better question and analyse who these jobs benefit and who they put at risk. If women and girls are the more vulnerable group, safeguards must be put in place to ensure gender equality.&nbsp; The EU can support its partner countries in designing and implementing economic and regulatory policies for the digital economy and digital work. Moreover, the D4D Hub can also provide opportunities for the EU to draw and share the lessons learnt in digital transformation for its own member states and partner countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Women and girls at the heart of data-driven society</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital transformation enables countries to shift to data-driven societies, with the implication that the data will be used more efficiently by governments, the private sector and civil society for designing, implementing and evaluating the policies. However, in the absence of gender-disaggregated data and statistics, the digital economy will fail to address the opportunities and challenges of more than half of the population. Every policy needs to be based on data that can provide insights on the gender impact of the digital economy and thus contribute to bridging the gender gap.&nbsp; This has to go hand in hand with the personal data protection regulation. The EU, through the D4D Hub, can share its best practices and lessons learned from data protection in line with the EU standards (e.g. the European&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\">General Data Protection Regulation&nbsp;</a>(GDPR) which harmonizes data privacy laws across Europe).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>&lsquo;If not now, when?&rsquo;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital transformation is happening now, and we all need to ensure that its benefits are equally available to everyone. While COVID-19 deepened the digital gender divide across developing countries, the EU can bring these countries back on the surge of inclusive and fair digital transformation by embedding gender equality in its Digital4Development agenda. Mahrang Baloch as well as other 450 million students across the world cannot wait another decade to have proper internet connection, digital skills, and equal opportunities to access the digital economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The time is now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Authors</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://stg.eui.eu/Fellowship/Policy-Leader-Fellows-20-21/Sumbal-Bashir\">Sumbal Bashir</a>&nbsp;is a Policy Leader Fellow at the EUI&rsquo;s School of Transnational Governance.

Digital transformation is a global challenge that demand<br />\r\ngovernments and policy makers to address multiple dimensions, in particularly in the context of<br />\r\nforeign policy. The EU has taken some concrete steps to respond faster and in a more coherent way<br />\r\nto ongoing and emerging global digital challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch of the new Global Europe instrument, worth &euro;79.5 billion over the MFF period 2021-<br />\r\n2027, marks a deep change of EU development policy. Moreover, EU recent initiatives reflected in<br />\r\nthe Digital4Development (D4D) approach as well as in the actions of the EU-AU Digital Economy Task<br />\r\nForce (DETF) can potentially enable the EU to be a reliable global player in the field of digital<br />\r\ncooperation. Nevertheless, if the EU wants to be relevant in the African continent, there are still<br />\r\nmany issues to be addressed to create a solid, multilateral and mutually-beneficial digital<br />\r\npartnership with Africa.<br />\r\nFirst, it is important to clarify to what extent the EU can successfully support African countries to<br />\r\naddress their digital development challenges. As African digital sphere is largely dominated both<br />\r\ntechnologically and geopolitically by the US and China, the role of the EU is still to be determined.<br />\r\nThe creation of the D4D Hub is certainly an important first step. Launched in December 2020, the<br />\r\nD4D is an initiative that is aimed at gathering key stakeholders from EU in order to scale up<br />\r\ninvestments to boost digital transformation and promote a strategic EU engagement in international<br />\r\ndigital partnerships in Africa. The D4D Hub was launched with the support of 12 EU member states<br />\r\n(Germany, France, Belgium, Estonia, Luxembourg, Finland, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Portugal,<br />\r\nSpain, Sweden) who promised to join the platform together with public institutions, industry, civil<br />\r\nsociety and academia.<br />\r\nHowever, the D4D can be an effective instrument only if EU member states are striving together to<br />\r\npromote international partnerships on digital transformation. At the moment, the D4D HUB has<br />\r\nbeen endorsed by less than half of the EU member states and many actors might be more interested<br />\r\nin digital cooperation with Africa only in terms of migration containment. This would certainly be a<br />\r\nhuge risk for the EU. The EU-Africa digital partnership can be effective only if it is based on a shared<br />\r\nand long-term multilateral strategy underpinned by transparency, political commitment and mutual<br />\r\ncooperation between European and African stakeholders.<br />\r\nSecond, lack of digital infrastructure is a huge problem that remain unsolved. Over 700 million<br />\r\npeople in Africa live without a functional internet connection. As a consequence, many are at risk to<br />\r\nbe excluded from digital opportunities, particularly women and vulnerable groups. It is unclear if the<br />\r\nEU has both the capacity and the political willingness to invest in African infrastructure. Yet, there<br />\r\nare many other areas in which the EU can effectively support Africa in the digital field.<br />\r\nRegulation and market harmonization remain the EU&rsquo;s greatest areas of global expertise. Digital<br />\r\nSingle Market (DSM) has seen a great number of successes that put the EU digital sphere at top of<br />\r\nthe world in terms of fair market regulation and citizens&rsquo; protection. These are certainly areas in<br />\r\nwhich the digital cooperation between the EU and Africa can achieve feasible and tangible results.<br />\r\nFor instance, the EU can provide an effective support in creating regulatory framework based on<br />\r\nDSM in Africa and replicate successful policies such as GDPR. At the same time, the EU policy makers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>should pay more attention to the growth of small and medium-sized businesses as at the moment<br />\r\nthe European expertise in this area is limited. For instance, the D4D Hub could be a great instrument<br />\r\nto learn more about African entrepreneurial digital ecosystems and support African entrepreneurs.<br />\r\nA better understanding of African digital ecosystem might help the EU to provide future support in<br />\r\ntaxation as well. Africa is potentially the biggest digital market of the world and there are almost a<br />\r\nbillion of potential new consumers of future digital services and products. While internet activity and<br />\r\nonline presence is still lower than in any other continent, the opportunities for giant tech in the<br />\r\nregion are huge. Therefore, it is crucial for the EU to support African countries in creating a fair and<br />\r\ntransparent tax framework.<br />\r\nLastly but most importantly, many challenges are linked to how the EU can support digital<br />\r\ninclusiveness in Africa. Ensuring affordability of internet and technologies for everyone will be a key<br />\r\nfactor to measure the effectiveness of the EU-Africa digital cooperation. Therefore, it is important<br />\r\nthat women and men benefit from digital transformation equally. Moreover, empowering women<br />\r\nand girls in the digital sphere, particularly in countries where social and ethnic divide is bigger, might<br />\r\nbe an effective way to provide tangible benefits for Africans, promote European values and address<br />\r\nan issue that has been largely ignored by the international community.<br />\r\nOne can claim that digital cooperation with Africa might seem a risky field in which the EU is going to<br />\r\nbe involved. It is certainly true that without a strong political involvement the EU is at risk to lose out<br />\r\nto other global players operating in Africa. However, digitalisation is also a topic where both the EU<br />\r\nand Africa aspire to develop a stronger and mutual beneficial cooperation: there are many<br />\r\nopportunities to be realized and more will be created through a stronger partnership. Thus, digital<br />\r\ncooperation is probably the most important field in which the EU can test the effectiveness of its<br />\r\nglobal ambitions.</p>', 'post', 'active', 31, '2021-05-05 07:04:21', '2021-05-05 04:04:21', '2021-05-11 04:35:56', 8, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'ru', '<p>COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly showing the world how much people&rsquo;s lives depend on digital<br />\r\ntechnologies and global connectivity.

EDDA is contributing to the EU Digital4Development policies and aims to ensure that EU digital policies in partner countries are fair, inclusive and gender-transformative.', '/photos/3/categories/EU Digital4Development.jpg', 1, 2, 7, 2, '2019-04-09 20:41:50', '2020-04-24 12:02:20'),

At the same time, recent developments in cognitive robotics, machine learning and unprecedented assigning of citizenship and rights to robots have pushed towards re-thinking the ethical, legal, socio-economic challenges and threats that they pose. To stay at the verge of the technological revolution and keep the level of EU competitiveness, the European Union has made the first steps towards forming the EU Artificial Intelligence Policy by creating High-Level Expert Group on AI in 2018, forming the ethical guidelines and communicating common EU stance on AI. EDDA is following and contributing to the work of the European Commission and High-Level Expert Group on AI and assess the policy developments and evolving practices in the area and their possible transfer to the neighboring and partner countries.', '/photos/3/categories/Artificial Intelligence.jpg', 1, 5, 4, 1, '2019-04-10 00:51:43', '2020-04-24 12:04:17'),

Cybercrime, such as attacks against information systems, online child sexual exploitation and non-cash payment fraud, affects the security and rights of individuals and businesses; it strengthens transnational criminal organisations, including those active in trafficking of drugs, firearms and in human beings, and enables terrorist organisations for propaganda, recruitment, training and financing purposes. In addition, cyber-attacks can seriously compromise the functioning of critical infrastructure upon which societies rely, putting therefore at risk the resilience of states. At the same time, many countries have only recently started to understand the challenges that could jeopardise their efforts from reaping of the benefits of increased access to the Internet for delivery of services like banking, health care or education.', '/photos/3/categories/Cyber security.jpg', 1, 6, 8, 1, '2019-04-10 00:59:20', '2020-04-24 12:04:43'),

The important place within this structural shift is reserved for the necessary skills needed to tackle this transformation, most importantly, digital skills, which are turning into the prerequisite for getting the job almost in any field. Therefore, the development of digital skills is gaining more and more attention at both EU and Member State level, and additionally, pose severe challenges: tackling possible future unemployment, re-skilling and re-training of the workforce, bridging the gender gap in ICT sector inside of the Member States as well as between them at the EU level. The European Union has made some progress to tackle the challenge by the creation of the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, announcing and progressing on the New Skills Agenda for Europe, introduction of Digital Skills Reward in 2018 and other.

Therefore, e-democracy should be strengthened, amplified by transparency and accountability mechanisms, expanding by innovative online instruments, reinforced by offline activism, stronger linked to formal policy making, sustainably institutionalised, and widely communicated to the public. EDD supports the Motion for a European Parliament Resolution on e-democracy in the European Union (2016/2008) and the Council of Europe Resolution (2015) on e-media for local and regional politicians.
